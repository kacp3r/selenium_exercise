# selenium_exercise

This is my exercise project for using Selenium with Python.
It takes notopstryk.pl, an e-commerce site, and runs a few test on it.

It uses unittest to write test suites, and distributes pages into different objects.
It uses the ddt library to get login information from text files.

It uses the nosetests library to create test reports in xml.
Bash scripts are used to run nosetests.
__init__.py files were added for nosetests to function correctly.
